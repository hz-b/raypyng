def collect_unique_values(list_of_dictionaries):
    """
    Collects unique values from a list of dictionaries,
    where each dictionary's values are lists of items.

    This function iterates over each dictionary in the provided list,
    extracting values which are expected to be lists. It then adds
    each item from these lists to a set to ensure all values are unique.

    Args:
        list_of_dictionaries (list of dict): A list of dictionaries,
                each containing one or more key-value pairs. The values
                are expected to be lists of items, potentially
                with duplicates.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing unique items extracted from all the value
                lists in the input dictionaries.
